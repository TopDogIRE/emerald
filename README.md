Create a client app and backend app in your personal repository. Your repository should have a client folder and service folder. The client folder will be created when you use the create-react-app tool, described here: https://create-react-app.dev/ (Links to an external site.). You will then create and use at least one React component.

You’ll create the service folder manually (`mkdir` in Linux or MacOS, `Create-Item` in Powershell). Once you’ve created it, you’ll create the entry point for your Express app and initialize an npm module. You can find more instructions here: https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html (Links to an external site.). You should have at least one route defined in your Express app which responds with a 200 Status Code and some html content.

You’ll submit a link to your personal github repo. The work for this week’s assignment will be on a branch named ‘week3’.
